# Pneumonia_CNN
Detecting if a Lung X-Ray Image has Pneumonia or not. 

In my opinion, AI's biggest application is Healthcare. Computaional Drug Design is one area in Healthcare where AI can have its biggest impacts. 

# Data
The dataset was taken from [Kaggle](kaggle.com). Here is the link to the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia). 

# Approach
I built a basic [CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_VrgWTKkiM). However, don't be mislead by the word 'basic'. This CNN had a training accuracy of 99% and a testing accuracy of 94%. I achieved some marvellous results with this "basic" CNN.
