# Pneumonia_CNN
Detecting if a Lung X-Ray Image has Pneumonia or not. 

In my opinion, AI's biggest application is Healthcare. Computaional Drug Design is one area in Healthcare where AI can have its biggest impacts. 

# Data
The dataset was taken from [Kaggle](kaggle.com). Here is the link to the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia). 

# Approach
I built a basic [CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_VrgWTKkiM). However, don't be mislead by the word 'basic'. This CNN had a training accuracy of 99% and a testing accuracy of 94%. I achieved some marvellous results with this "basic" CNN.

# About Me
My name is Harsh Darji. I am from Bangalore, Karnataka, India. I am 15 years old, and have just finished my grade 10.
*And no I am not bluffing.* I have been interested in AI and programming in general since I was 12. I am completley 
self-taught. I just went on YouTube and some courses online and learned about all this. I decided to work on this project because I saw my country's detoriating condition due to the Novel Corona Virus. I love helping people and I thought that this was the perfect opportunity for me to contribute to the community. 

You can reach me at my email address - harshdarji750@gmail.com to have a little chat.
