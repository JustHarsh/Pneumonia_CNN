# Pneumonia_CNN
Detecting if a Lung X-Ray Image has Pneumonia or not. 

In my opinion, AI's biggest application is Healthcare. Computaional Drug Design is one area in Healthcare where AI can have its biggest impacts. 

# Data
The dataset was taken from [Kaggle](kaggle.com). Here is the link to the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia). 

# Approach
I built a basic [CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_VrgWTKkiM). The CNN has a achieved an accuracy of 89% on the testing set. 

**About Convolutional Neural Networks -** The architecture of a ConvNet is analogous to that of the connectivity pattern of Neurons in the Human Brain and was inspired by the organization of the Visual Cortex. Individual neurons respond to stimuli only in a restricted region of the visual field known as the Receptive Field. A collection of such fields overlap to cover the entire visual area.

**Libraries used -** Tensorflow for deep learning, Numpy for basic Mathematical calculations, Matplotlib for visualization. 
- Tensorflow - TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for dataflow and differentiable programming across a range of tasks. It is a symbolic math library, and is also used for machine learning applications such as neural networks.
- NumPy - NumPy is a python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.
- Matplotlib is an amazing visualization library in Python for 2D plots of arrays. Matplotlib is a multi-platform built for data visualization library built on NumPy arrays.
